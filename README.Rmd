# ubccv

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ubccv is to allow you to use R Markdown to create and edit your UBC Faculty CV without having to touch a word document.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ttimbers/ubccv")
```
## Usage

1. Inside RStudio, click on "Create a new R Markdown document":

2. Next, select "ubc-cv-teaching-stream" from the "From Template" menu:

<img src="man/figures/template.png" width=500>

3. Edit the document to add text, and add data to the 7 `.csv` files to fill in the tables. 

4. Click the "knit" button to render to Word! ðŸ˜‚

## Annual Reports

You can also use this to create an annual report, along the same lines.  Select "ubc-ar-teaching-stream" instead, when choosing a template.

* If you use the summary table, you should edit it lightly in Word after for alignment; see the "tips" in in the document.
